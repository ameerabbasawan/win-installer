                          popHealth Windows Installer

===== WARNING === WARNING === WARNING === WARNING === WARNIN === WARNING =====

This repository contains the files and scripts necessary to build a one-click
installer of popHealth for Windows users.  This is not the place to go if you
just want to install popHealth on a Windows platform.  However, is you are a
developer, working to enhance or update the installer for the latest version
of popHealth, than you're in the right place.

=====================
+  Prerequisites:
=====================

* NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System)

  The windows installer is built using the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation
  System (NSIS) tool.  Specifically, it was designed with version 2.46 of the
  tool.

  NSIS Project URL: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
  NSIS Documentation: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs

* OLE-COM Object Viewer

  While not explicitly necessary to build the installer, some aspects of
  installing something on windows (i.e. adding a scheduled task) require
  invoking Windows components via an Object Linking & Embedding (OLE) or
  Common Object Model (COM) interface.  Doing this from an NSIS install script
  requires determining the ordinal number of the desired COM interface
  function.  The OLE-COM Object Viewer allows the COM interfaces installed on
  the system to be browsed to determine these numbers.  It is included with
  Microsoft's Visual Studio development environment.  I believe that it is
  also part of the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.


=====================
+  Building
=====================

Building the installer is quite simple.  After installing NSIS, make sure the
NSIS install directory is included in the PATH environment variable.  From the
directory where this file resides, simply execute the following command:

  makensis popHealth.nsi

If all goes well, this will create an executable called popHealth.exe which is
the one-click installer for the popHealth project.
