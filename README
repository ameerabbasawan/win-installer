                          popHealth Windows Installer

===== WARNING === WARNING === WARNING === WARNING === WARNIN === WARNING =====

This repository contains the files and scripts necessary to build a one-click
installer of popHealth for Windows users.  This is not the place to go if you
just want to install popHealth on a Windows platform.  However, is you are a
developer, working to enhance or update the installer for the latest version
of popHealth, than you're in the right place.

=====================
+  Prerequisites:
=====================

* NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System)

  The windows installer is built using the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation
  System (NSIS) tool.  Specifically, it was designed with version 2.46 of the
  tool.

  NSIS Project URL: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
  NSIS Documentation: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs
  Downloads: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

* unzip command

  The batch file that prepares this directory prior to running the installer
  uses the unzip command.  If you are using the Windows git client included in
  this directory, it includes the necessary command.  Simply add the directory
  <GIT HOME>\bin to your PATH and you'll be set.  <GIT HOME> refers to the
  directory where git is installed (C:\Program Files\Git by default).

* OLE-COM Object Viewer (optional)

  While not explicitly necessary to build the installer, some aspects of
  installing something on windows (i.e. adding a scheduled task) require
  invoking Windows components via an Object Linking & Embedding (OLE) or
  Common Object Model (COM) interface.  Doing this from an NSIS install script
  requires determining the ordinal number of the desired COM interface
  function.  The OLE-COM Object Viewer allows the COM interfaces installed on
  the system to be browsed to determine these numbers.  It is included with
  Microsoft's Visual Studio development environment.  I believe that it is
  also part of the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.


=====================
+  Building
=====================

Building the installer is quite simple.  After installing NSIS, make sure the
NSIS install tool directory (C:\Program Files\NSIS by default) and the Git bin
directory are included in the PATH environment variable.  From the directory
where this file resides, simply execute the following commands:

  preparefor [32 | 64]
  makensis popHealth.nsi

The first command is a batch file that prepares the directory for either a 32
or a 64 bit build of the installer.  If no option is specified, 32 bit is
used as a default.

If all goes well, this will create an executable called either
popHealth.exe (32 bit) or popHealth-x86_64.exe (64 bit) which is the one-click
installer for the popHealth project for the respective architecture.
